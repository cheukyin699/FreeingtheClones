== Freeing The Clones ==
Freeing the Clones (also called 'Pebbling the Chessboard') 
is a game where there are checker pieces called clones/pebbles. 
Clones are denoted by the circles in the cells(squares).
The goal of the game is to get all the clones out of the 'prison' on the lower left hand corner
(Denoted by the red squares) and into the outside world.

You can only move clones by 'cloning' - having a clone clone itself onto the upper and right side
of the original clone, and then 'kill' itself, leaving two new clones in its upper and right positions.
Cloning can be achieved by clicking on a clone, and NOT AN EMPTY CELL.
You cannot clone if there are no clones on the square or if either of the two new clones' spawn positions
are obstructed, in which case the cloning would be unsuccessful.
